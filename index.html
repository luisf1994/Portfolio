        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> I am a college student finishing up my associates program this summer majoring in business administration. I enjoyed my years as college student, but I felt that business was not really what I am passionate about. I have always liked the idea of being able to create things, and add beautiful design to this creations recently I found out how much I enjoy designing, and programming. So I decide to spend more time trying to learn the skills to become a developer, and designer.</p>
        <p> This is some more information  about what I enjoy doing outside of work, studying, and what I hope to achieve. I enjoy hiking the North Georgia Mountains, running 5Ks, trying out new foods, and meeting new people. One of my goals after mastering these new skills is to become a digital nomad, because I like the idea of being able to move around and seeing what the world has to offer. Technology is making it easier for people to see the world, but we stay in our comfort zone. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites, mobile apps, and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Swift</li>
